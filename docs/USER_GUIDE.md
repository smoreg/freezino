- After working, you'll see statistics comparing:
  - Time needed to earn $500 in different countries
  - How your virtual "wage" compares to reality

### Educational Statistics

After completing work, you'll see:
- 🇺🇸 **USA**: Would take ~16.7 minutes at average wage
- 🇷🇺 **Russia**: Would take ~1.7 hours
- 🇮🇳 **India**: Would take ~3.5 hours
- And more countries...

This helps you understand the **value of money** in different contexts.

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this real gambling?**
A: No! All money is virtual. You cannot deposit or withdraw real money.

**Q: Why does the house always win?**
A: Just like real casinos, games have a small "house edge" built in. This is educational - showing how casinos make money.

A: Yes! We only collect your email and name from Google. See our Privacy Policy for details.

### Game Questions

**Q: Are the games fair?**
A: Yes! We use cryptographically secure random number generation. Games are fair but have realistic house edges.

**Q: Why can't I win consistently?**
A: That's the educational point! Gambling games are designed so the house wins in the long run.
