# Cookie Policy

**Last Updated: November 8, 2024**

## 1. Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how **Freezino** uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.

## 2. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to website owners.

### Types of Cookies:
- **Session cookies:** Temporary cookies that expire when you close your browser
- **Persistent cookies:** Cookies that remain on your device until they expire or you delete them
- **First-party cookies:** Set by the website you're visiting (Freezino)
- **Third-party cookies:** Set by external services (e.g., Google OAuth)

## 3. Cookies We Use

Freezino uses a minimal number of cookies, categorized as follows:

### 3.1 Essential Cookies (Always Active)

These cookies are **necessary** for the website to function and cannot be disabled.

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration | Type |
|-------------|---------|----------|------|
| `auth_token` | Stores your JWT authentication token to keep you logged in | Session / 7 days | Essential |
| `language` | Remembers your language preference (en, ru, es) | 1 year | Essential |
| `cookie_consent` | Stores your cookie consent preferences | 1 year | Essential |

**Why we need these:**
- **`auth_token`**: Required for authentication and accessing your account
- **`language`**: Ensures the interface displays in your preferred language
- **`cookie_consent`**: Remembers your cookie preferences so we don't ask again

### 3.2 Functional Cookies (Optional)

These cookies enhance your experience but are not essential. You can opt out.

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Duration | Type |
|-------------|---------|----------|------|
| `ui_preferences` | Stores UI settings (dark mode, sound on/off, animations) | 1 year | Functional |
| `game_settings` | Remembers your game preferences (bet amounts, favorites) | 30 days | Functional |

**What happens if you disable these:**
- Your UI preferences will reset each visit
- You'll need to reconfigure settings like dark mode and sound

### 3.3 Analytics Cookies (Opt-In Only)

We **do not use analytics cookies by default**. If enabled in the future (with your consent), they would help us understand how users interact with Freezino.

**Current status:** Not implemented

## 4. Local Storage

In addition to cookies, Freezino uses **browser Local Storage** to store:
- **User preferences** (game favorites, display settings)
- **Session data** (temporary game state)
- **Cache** (for faster loading)

Local Storage data stays on your device and is not sent to our servers automatically.

## 5. Third-Party Cookies
